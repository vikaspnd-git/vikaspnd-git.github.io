## Introduction

Hi, I am Vikas Pandey, pursuing PhD at IIT Jodhpur. I joined the Interdisciplinary Research Program of Space Science and Technology, here at IITJ, in March 2021. My graduation and master's degrees are in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology, Arunachal Pradesh.

Born with a curious mind, I explored many fields and professions. I started as a student of Electronics and developed an interest in circuits, antennas, comparators and microprocessors. It gradually led me to the world of digital design, embedded systems, control, automation, and eventually robotics. Pursuing it further I worked as a Robotics trainer, where I learnt to teach, interact and coach students along with gaining skills in coding, machine learning, and life skills. There I came across 3D printers and started dedicating a large chunk of my leisure time to understanding and frugal them. In the way of understanding it, I started asking lots of "what, why and how". This genesis of thirst for quest and my realization of the ability to quench it with scientific reasoning led me into research.

I did M. Tech. and worked as Research and Development Engineer for some time before joining the PhD program. In my PhD, I am working on the project "AlGaN/GaN High Electron mobility based gas sensors for space application", under the esteemed supervision of Dr Mahesh Kumar (Department of Electrical Engineering) and Dr Ankur Gupta (Department of Mechanical Engineering).

Apart from academics, I write poetry and love teaching.
